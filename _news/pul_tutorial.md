In the context of our advanced AI topics course, I recorded an introductory tutorial on **Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data**, which can be found at <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/pulearning/">https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/tutorials/pulearning/</a>.

The goal of the tutorial is to introduce you to the PU learning field and get an overview of the main assumptions and classes of techniques in the field. The tutorial consists of 6 videos about the following topics:
1. PU Learning and its Sources
2. PU Learning Definitions
3. PU Learning Assumptions
4. Two-Step Techniques
5. Biased Learning
6. Labeling Mechanism Incorporation

The tutorial largely follows our survey paper: TODO
