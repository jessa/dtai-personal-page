Hi, I am {{ site.first_name }} {{ site.last_name }}, a Postdoc in the [DTAI](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) research group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) working with [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt). I obtained my PhD in 2018, under supervision of [Jesse Davis](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/). I did an industrial intermezzo at [Acapela](https://www.acapela-group.com/), where I investigated expressive speech synthesis.

My main research interests include integrating learning and reasoning, learning from positive and unlabeled data, probabilistic graphical models, tractable learning, structure learning, and knowledge compilation. I enjoy industry collaborations because they inspire and motivate interesting research and allow for early validation of theoretical findings.
