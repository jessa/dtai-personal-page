### Community Service
#### Mentoring Young Computer Scientists

**Ladies@Science** 
: [Ladies@Science](https://wet.kuleuven.be/ladiesatscience) from KU Leuven gives the opportunity to high school girls to sample science studies and research for an afternoon. I have been a project leader for the workshops of 2017 and 2018.

**Innovation Lab**
: [Innovation Lab](https://eng.kuleuven.be/innovationlab) from KU Leuven designs science projects that high school teachers can organize in their classroom. I was involved in the artificial intelligence project in which the students build a poker bot.

**Summer School Project Leader**
: The [Summer School of Science (S3)](http://drustvo-evo.hr/s3/s3_2015.html#p4) is an international summer school students of ninth and tenth grade where they work on a science project in a group of 4 students. I designed and led the speech recognition project of 2015.

**CoderDojo Coach**
: [CoderDojo](http://www.coderdojobelgium.be/en) is a global movement of free coding clubs for young people. I was a Scratch coach in the Belgian division in 2014-2016.

**KinderUniversiteit**
: At [KinderUniversiteit (Childrens' University)](http://www.kuleuven.be/kinderuniversiteit/) 8-13 year olds get to go to university for one day where they attend lectures and workshops. In 2015 I was twice a mentor of a workshop where they used Scratch on a Raspberry Pi.
